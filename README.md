# About
This project allows users to select a city and country by clicking on the map. Weather from the nearest city and statistics about that country will appear.

## Done
- Get weather for city where pin is dropped
- Get statistics for country where pin is dropped

Note: Not all locations currently working as the stats APIs that's used to search data doesn't recognize some region names. Most parts of North American, Europe and Austrailia work.

## Needs Work
- Set up error handling on API call
- Adding more stats for countries

## Planned
- Having multiple info cards open side by side and ability to close them
- Text search that places pin and displays stats
- Start marker and info at current location using IP address
